# Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts the closing price of Netflix stock using historical data and machine learning techniques. The web interface is powered by Flask, allowing users to input stock data and receive predictions.


## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model that predicts stock prices based on features such as open, high, low, adjusted close prices, volume, and date (year, month, day). The model is built using the Linear Regression algorithm, trained on historical Netflix stock data.

The project consists of two parts:
1. **Frontend**: A simple web interface built using HTML and CSS where users can input stock data.
2. **Backend**: A Flask-based API that processes user input, runs the prediction model, and returns the predicted closing stock price.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression (using scikit-learn)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Deployment**: GitHub
